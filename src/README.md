MP5
==================
//Tony Li
//MP5:
implement the two class AACMappings and AACCategory with the exist structure AssociativeArray.  
AACCategory class will likely contain an AssociativeArray<String,String> that maps image locations (strings) to words (also strings).
AACMappings class will likely contain an AACCategory object that maps filenames to their corresponding words. You may also want an AssociativeArray<String,AACCategory> that maps either filenames or names to categories.
